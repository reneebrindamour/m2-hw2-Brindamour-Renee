    <h1><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h1>
    <p>My name is Renee Brindamour. I was born, raised, and currently live in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I am a 46-year-old Mom to a 16 year-old son.</p> 
    
    <p>I, also, have a Shih Tzu named Hudson, and two ornery cats named Sonic and Tails. My son named the cats after characters from one of his video games. </p>
    
    <p>What brought me to the University of Florida to pursue my Master's degree?</p> 
    
    <p>I lost my dad to stage 4 lung cancer in January 2024. He was my best friend. Before he passed away, he made me promise that, in his legacy, I would pursue happiness, always strive to do what was best for my son and me, and love life. I decided at that moment to continue my education in his name. So, here I am. My son was my reason for getting my BA, and my dad is my reason for pursuing my MA.</p>

    <h2><strong>CAREER GOALS</strong></h2>
    <p>Although I have a great job, I would like to use the skills I learn in this program to transition into either a design management or developer role. Currently, we are using CMS systems (Drupal) to build our web pages, which doesn't provide me with much practice or experience in coding. I am looking for a job where I can build on my skills, continuing to learn and develop my developer skills. </p>
    <p>Additionally, I aspire to start my own web and graphic design company and become my own boss.</p>
