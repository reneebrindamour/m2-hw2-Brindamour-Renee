    <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
    <p>My name is Renee Brindamour. I was born, raised, and currently live in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I have a 16-year-old son, a Shih Tzu named Hudson, and two ornery cats named Sonic and Tails. My son named the cats after characters from one of his video games. </p>
    
    <p>What brought me to the University of Florida to pursue my Master's degree?</p> 
    
    <p>I lost my dad to stage 4 lung cancer in January 2024. He was my best friend. Before he passed away, he made me promise that, in his legacy, I would pursue happiness, always strive to do what was best for my son and me, and love life. I decided at that moment to continue my education in his name. So, here I am. My son was my reason for getting my BA, and my dad is my reason for pursuing my MA.</p>

    <h2><strong>School History</strong></h2>
    <p>I graduated from Southern New Hampshire University in 2023 with a BA in Graphic and Web Design.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I studied at the New York Institute of Photography. Although this is not an accredited school, it was a truly enriching experience. It taught me a great deal about photography, composition, and developing a keen eye for detail.</p>
    
    <h2><strong>Academic Organizations Affiliations</strong></h2>
    <p>I belong to the National Society of Leadership and Success</p>

    <h2><strong>Employment</strong></h2>
    <p>I am presently employed with the University of Michigan as a Web Designer for Michigan Medicine.</p>
    
    <h2><strong>Career Goals</strong></h2>
    <p>Although I have a great job, I would like to use the skills I learn in this program to transition into either a design management or developer role. Currently, we are using CMS systems to build our web pages, which doesn't provide me with much practice or experience in coding. I am looking for a job where I can continue to learn and develop the skills that interest me the most. </p>
    <p>Additionally, I aspire to start my own web and graphic design company and become my own boss.</p>
